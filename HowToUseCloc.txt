In short, open the terminal.(If you are on Windows 11 you should have a program called Terminal preinstalled, otherwise you can open cmd.exe)

Once you have it open, navigate to you project folder. You can do that with the command 'cd' (change directory) followed by the path of the folder e.g. "cd C:\Programming\ShootRock\"

Once you are in the right folder you can do "cloc ./Source" to cound the number of lines in every source file in the ./Source folder. There is a lot more you can see with the cloc program, for example "cloc --by-file ./Source" will count the lines in each file seperately.
