# Space Invaders 2023

This project is a refactoring exercise in my API Design & Best Practices-course.
In this course we learn about Modern C++, clean code and basics of API Design, and I provide my own "solution" to the exercise after the course ends, for students to review and compare with.

The game is a clone of Space Invaders, written in C++ using Raylib. 
The original source code was kindly donated by a pair of students who wrote it in one of their first programming courses.
